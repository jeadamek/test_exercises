### 03. Exercise
First the alert shows "Jack", because it is the alert from inside the function identify(). So, it is alerting the 'name' variable.
The second alert is the one called by the end of the program. It alerts the 'who' variable, that contains the return from the identify() function,but the variable name is in a line bellow the function's return, so it doesn't return the name variable, in fact it doesn't return any value, so it alerts "undefined".
